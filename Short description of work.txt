This program uses the "Input.txt" file as a dictionary and then
finds out how many times each word from the dictionary is mentioned in Text.txt.

Programming data structure choice:
The used data structure to create the dictionary is Hash Table, where
each word is used as a key that is mapped to the value of its occurrences.

Program limitations:
Each line should be shorter than 256 symbols.
The size of the Hash Table is limited to memory.
The program should work fine with files containing different types of symbols. 

Possible areas for improvement:
1. The input files are hardcoded, a good improvement is adding an option to choose files.
2. Main.c file is too long, some of the code can be moved to other C files.
3. Although I have refactored the code there are still repeating lines and some magic numbers.
